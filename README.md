This is a very simple frontend application that uses ChatGPT to create recipes for cooking or cocktails with your own ingredients.
Using the mechanics of prompts, the application returns 5 recipes for an appetizer, main course, dessert or cocktail, with an introduction worthy of the biggest food blog influencers!
